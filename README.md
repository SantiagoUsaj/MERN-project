# MERN Project

This repository contains my work following the [Complete MERN Beginner Course (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcxjCPeicvU).

## About

I'm learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) by building a full-stack application step by step. Each branch in this repo corresponds to a part of the course.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MERN-project.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   cd MERN-project
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # In the root folder
   npm run dev
   # In the client folder
   npm start
   ```

## Branches

- Each branch matches a section of the course for easier reference.
